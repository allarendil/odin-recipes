    <h1>Let's make a Snack!</h1>
    <img src="../images/granola.jpg">
    <p>This granola dish is easy to whip up in a matter of minutes! <br />
        Prep it ahead of time and store in an airtight container for <br />
        an easy snack!</p>
    <p>This healthy snack will last a couple weeks if stored properly, <br />
        but it doesn't last that long in my house!  <br />
        My favorite way to eat this is in a bowl with some milk <br />
        like an almost guilt-free cereal!</p>
    <p>The ingredients listed below are very loose <br />
        you can modify, omit, or add onto any of them!  Such as using <br />
        honey instead of maple syrup, or any kind of nuts you have on hand.  <br />
        Make it nut-free and just use oats and dried fruit! <br />
        The world is your oyster!</p>
    <p>This recipe will yield about 4 cups of granola, but that depends on <br />
        how much you add!  I prefer to measure with the heart and just throw <br />
        everything in.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cup Nuts of choice (I like to use a mix)</li>
            <li>1 cup Dry Oats</li>
            <li>1 cup Chocolate Chips</li>
            <li>3 tbs Flax Seed</li>
            <li>3 tbs Chia Seed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Maple Syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Melted Coconut Oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
            <li>Dump all ingredients in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Mix everything together thoroughly</li>
            <li>Spread mixture onto a parchment lined baking sheet</li>
            <li>bake about 25 minutes</li>
        </ol>
    <p>And that's it!  Let it cool and store in a cool dry space. <br />
        But don't forget to enjoy some while its still warm!  </p>
