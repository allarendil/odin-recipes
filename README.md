This is my first html project with Odin!
I will come back to this later with a more complete description!!

This project has a landing page called Odin Recipes
that links to three different recipe pages.

Each recipe page includes an image and a description of the recipe
followed by a list of ingredients and instructions

I used basic CSS to style the pages to make recipe cards
