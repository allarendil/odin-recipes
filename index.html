    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>I cook for my family of five multiple times every day, so <br />
        when it comes to the kitchen, I like to make food that is <br />
        healthy, quick, and easy to prepare! <br />
        The majority of the food I make is also kid approved!</p>
    <p> The recipes below are some of our favorite foods to enjoy <br />
        (yes, the kids love the kale!) <br />
        And, they all take roughly ten minutes to prepare <br />
        Win, Win!</p>
